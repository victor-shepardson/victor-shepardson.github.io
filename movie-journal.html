<h1>Movie Journal</h1>

This is a list of movies I enjoyed with some notes to remember them by.

<h2>Mapplethorpe (2018) & Variety (1983)</h2>
<h3>Ondi Timoner & Bette Gordon, respectively.</h3>
<p> Commonality: horny 70s-80s NYC. Mapplethorpe is a biopic about the photographer: a narcissist, sometimes cruel to those around him yet also a tireless champion for the beauty and dignity of his subjects. </p>
<p> Variety is about Christine, the ticket-taker at a porno theater box office. She takes the job reluctantly, but goes on to observe the experience with a calm journalistic fascination. Most of the movie revolves around her relationship with Louis Tancredi, a man who hits on her repeatedly at work and whose invitation to a Yankees game she spontaneously accepts. When he leaves suddenly during the game, their relationship as stalker and object of fascination inverts just as abruptly and inexplicably. Christine follows Louis through the night watching him meet people and make mysterious deals at a bus station, a fish market, a motel. Her  observation of Louis blurs together vaguely with her boyfriend (?) Mark's investigative journalism into mafia infiltration of labor unions. Mark is very put off when she begins to recite erotic poetry to him during their distinctly unerotic meetings. She begins reading porno magazines and dressing in lingerie, privately. The movie ends as Christine consummates her fascination with Louis, spooking him over the phone with a recitation of his movements. She sets up a meeting at a street corner, leaving her intentions to his, and our, imaginations. </p>

<h2> Cameraperson (2016) </h2>
<h3> Kirsten Johnson </h3>
<p> A docu-memoir assembled from footage shot during Johnson's career as a documentary cinematographer plus some home movies. Punctuated by a few intensely striking scenes: the furious boxer, the regretful soldier, the tired midwife.</p>

<h2> Into the Inferno (2016) </h2>
<h3> Werner Herzog </h3>
<p> Good Werner. Volcanos, with the usual tangents. The Vanuatans. The vulcanologist and paleoanthropologist. The DPRK. </p>

<h2> Leviathan (2012) </h2>
<h3> Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Verena Paravel </h3>
<p> Darkly psychedelic document of deep-sea fishing.</p>

<h2> Uncut Gems (2019) </h2>
<h3> Benny & Josh Safdie</h3>
<p> Adam Sandler as Howie, the most annoying person on Earth. Kevin Garnett as himself but obsessed with Howie's giant opal, sourced directly from an Ethiopian mine. Howie and girlfriend Julia are addicted to risk. Tension builds steadily via Howie's schemes and the pounding synth score until completely unbearable. </p>

<h2> Stalker (1979) </h2>
<h3> Andrei Tarkovksy </h3>
<p> Mysterious and meditative and gorgeous in that Tarkovsky way. The Zone. Upsetting to learn that probably everyone involved was poisoned by industrial waste at the shooting locations for the first version which was mostly lost to bad film processing.</p>

<h2> The Wicker Man (1973) </h2>
<h3> Robin Hardy </h3>
<p> </p>

<h2> Mandy (2018) </h2>
<h3> Panos Cosmatos, Casper Kelly </h3>
<p> "The psychotic drowns where the mystic swims" </p>

<h2> Midsommar (2019) </h2>
<h3> Ari Aster </h3>
<p> Incredible, most enthralling and viscerally upsetting movie I have ever seen. Shattering. </p>
