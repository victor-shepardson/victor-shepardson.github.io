<h1>Movie Journal</h1>

This is a list of movies I enjoyed with some notes to remember them by.

<h2> A Room With A View (1985) </h2>
<h3> James Ivory </h3>
<h4> see also: Barry Lyndon, The Wicker Man </h4>
<p> Baby Helena Bonham Carter walks a knife-edge between virgin and chad. (She has the passive obedience of a virgin, but plays Beethoven like a total chad). On a trip to Florence with terrible cousin Charlotte (an exquisitely warped creature), the two of them see some naked statues and fall into the company of chads. Foremost of the chads is George, who is instantly obsessed with BHBC. George positively exudes trickster-bro energy; his main move is first unsubtly showing BHBC giant question marks, but when that doesn't work he switches to grabbing and forcibly kissing her. She doesn't know quite what to make of this. Neither does Charlotte, who appears torn between thinking this is super hot and that it is horrifying. Back at home, BHBC agrees to marry Pointy Daniel Day-Lewis, an utter virgin. PDDL's asinine machinations fatefully bring George to the neighborhood, and he gleefully spoils the deal. George persuades BHBC to escape the life of a virgin with terrible PDDL and terrible Charlotte and her terrible mother. After breaking off their engagement BHBC makes some noises about not needing another man to leave PDDL for. But this is apparently a "lie"; BHBC does <i>not</i> reach escape velocity, settling for option B and running off to Italy again with George. Their room has a view, terrible Charlotte isn't there to stop him from groping her, happy ending?</p>

<h2> Days of Heaven (1978) </h2>
<h3> Terrence Malick </h3>
<p> Villain: locusts, capital. Hero: other animals, wheat. Beautiful. </p>

<h2> Barton Fink (1991) </h2>
<h3> Joel & Ethan Coen </h3>
<p> One of those movies about Hollywood eating someone alive. Barton is an insufferable New York playwright how goes to LA to make some cash. He finds it vapid, disturbing, and scary, but mostly just deeply uninteresting. He's supposed to write a "wrestling picture", but doesn't know what that is and doesn't care to find out. His own art is explicitly about dignifying the common man, but he doesn't know what the common man is like and doesn't care to find out. As flamin' John Goodman puts it, he doesn't listen. But he does get what he deserves. </p>

<h2> The Most Unknown (2018) </h2>
<h3> Ian Cheney </h3>
<h4> see also: Into The Inferno, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Encounters at the End of the World </h4>
<p> Herzog-like (he is credited as an advisor) documentary, though more conventional. Specifically, this is a movie about <i>scientist energy</i>. Nine scientists visit each other's workplaces in a ring-topological arrangement, and mainly we get to watch them just be huge nerds of every type. Hilarious. </p>

<h2>Mapplethorpe (2018) & Variety (1983)</h2>
<h3>Ondi Timoner & Bette Gordon, respectively.</h3>
<p> Commonality: horny 70s-80s NYC. Mapplethorpe is a biopic about the photographer: a narcissist, sometimes cruel to those around him yet also a tireless champion for the beauty and dignity of his subjects. </p>
<p> Variety is about Christine, the ticket-taker at a porno theater box office. She takes the job reluctantly, but goes on to observe the experience with a calm journalistic fascination. Most of the movie revolves around her relationship with Louis Tancredi, a man who hits on her repeatedly at work and whose invitation to a Yankees game she spontaneously accepts. When he leaves suddenly during the game, their relationship as stalker and object of fascination inverts just as abruptly and inexplicably. Christine follows Louis through the night watching him meet people and make mysterious deals at a bus station, a fish market, a motel. Her  observation of Louis blurs together vaguely with her boyfriend (?) Mark's investigative journalism into mafia infiltration of labor unions. Mark however is  put off when Christine begins to recite erotic poetry to him during their distinctly unerotic meetings. She begins reading porno magazines and dressing in lingerie, privately. In the end Christine consummates her fascination with Louis, spooking him over the phone with a recitation of his movements. She sets up a meeting at a street corner, leaving her intentions to the imagination. </p>

<h2> Cameraperson (2016) </h2>
<h3> Kirsten Johnson </h3>
<p> A docu-memoir assembled from footage shot during Johnson's career as a documentary cinematographer plus some home movies. Punctuated by a few intensely striking scenes: the furious boxer, the regretful soldier, the tired midwife. </p>

<h2> Into the Inferno (2016) </h2>
<h3> Werner Herzog </h3>
<p> Good Werner, a straight (?) documentary about scientists, myth, ways of being. Volcanos, plus tangents. The Vanuatans. The vulcanologist and paleoanthropologist. The DPRK. </p>

<h2> Leviathan (2012) </h2>
<h3> Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Verena Paravel </h3>
<p> Darkly psychedelic document of commercial fishing. Hacking the wings from rays. Metal. </p>

<h2> Yojimbo (1961) </h2>
<h3> Akira Kurosawa </h3>
<p> </p>

<h2> Dersu Uzala (1975) </h2>
<h3> Akira Kurosawa </h3>
<p> Dersu is a hunter who lives alone in the woods. He talks to fire. He doesn't miss a shot. He fears and respects the tiger. He knows how to not die when some doofus Russian gets him stranded on a frozen lake. Shot in color, very beautiful and melancholy.</p>

<h2> Uncut Gems (2019) </h2>
<h3> Benny & Josh Safdie</h3>
<p> Adam Sandler as Howie, the most annoying person on Earth. Kevin Garnett as himself but obsessed with Howie's giant opal, sourced directly from an Ethiopian mine. Howie and soulmate/dominatrix Julia are addicted to risk. Tension mounts as Howie wheedles and lies and schemes and pawns, the pounding synth score building until completely unbearable. Then, blammo. </p>

<h2> Stalker (1979) </h2>
<h3> Andrei Tarkovksy </h3>
<p> Mysterious and meditative and gorgeous in that Tarkovsky way. Those vibrating spring sounds as they enter the Zone. Upsetting that probably everyone involved was poisoned by industrial waste while shooting the first version. (Lost to bad processing! fuck!)</p>

<h2> The Wicker Man (1973) </h2>
<h3> Robin Hardy </h3>
<h4> see also: Midsommar, A Room With A View </h4>
<p> </p>

<h2> Mandy (2018) </h2>
<h3> Panos Cosmatos, Casper Kelly </h3>
<p> "The psychotic drowns where the mystic swims" </p>

<h2> Andrei Rublev (1966) </h2>
<h3> Andrei Tarkovksy </h3>
<p> Andrei and the pagans; casting the bell. </p>

<h2> Midsommar (2019) </h2>
<h3> Ari Aster </h3>
<h4> see also: The Wicker Man </h4>
<p> Incredible, most enthralling and viscerally upsetting movie I have ever seen. Shattering. </p>

<h2> Us (2019) </h2>
<h3> Jordan Peele </h3>
<p> Dude can really work an allegory. Great score. </p>
