<h1>Movie Journal</h1>

This is a list of movies I enjoyed with some notes to remember them by. If you are reading this for some reason and aren't me, you should know there are spoilers in here.

<h2> Black Orpheus (1959) </h2>
<h3> Marcel Camus </h3>
<p> A movie about partying. </p>

<h2> Throne of Blood (1957) </h2>
<h3> Akira Kurosawa </h3>
<p> The mist. The forest spirit's hut. </p>

<h2> My Octopus Teacher (2020) </h2>
<h3> James Reed & Pippa Ehrlich </h3>
<h4> See also: Leviathan </h4>
<p> A movie about being inside of nature. </p>

<h2> Day Of The Jackal (1973) </h2>
<h3> Fred Zinneman </h3>
<p> The assassin, realistically? But from the outside. Gets dumber as it goes on. </p>

<h2> Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1978) </h2>
<h3> Philip Kaufman </h3>
<h4> see also: Alien </h4>
<p> The dog! </p>

<h2> The Haunted Palace (1963) </h2>
<h3> Roger Corman </h3>
<p> Good and goofy. </p>

<h2> Alien (1979) </h2>
<h3> Ridley Scott </h3>
<h4> see also: Invasion Of The Body Snatchers </h4>
<p> What struck me this time: not really a good movie at storytelling. Which is sort of a strength, I think Scott managed just enough control to make it watchable, without trampling too much on the vision of its Jodorowsky-addled worldbuilding scifi weirdos. Pretty bad score, I see there are a lot of fan re-scores online. Wonder if any are good. Still a movie I want to keep watching, maybe because it suggests an even better one. </p>

<h2> My Cousin Vinny (1992) </h2>
<h3> Jonathan Lynn </h3>
<h4> see also: Uncut Gems </h4>
<p> Way funnier than its own jokes. Strong candidate for stupidest/most entertaining movie. </p>

<h2> Dangerous Liaisons (1988) </h2>
<h3> Stephen Frears </h3>
<h4> see also: Nosferatu, Barry Lyndon, A Room With A View </h4>
<p> Malkovitch is a dracula in this movie and Glenn Close is a demon. </p>

<h2> Seven Samurai (1954) </h2>
<h3> Akira Kurosawa </h3>
<h4> see also: Yojimbo </h4>
<p> "Even bears come down from the mountains when they're hungry." Every kind of bear: the captain (Kambei), the right hand man (Gorobei), the right hand man jr (Katsushiro), the solid dude (Shichirōji), the solid dude jr (Heihachi), the unsettling nerd (Kyuzo), and the joker (Kikuchiyo). <i>Technically</i> two are the same kind of guy only younger, and two are not actually samurai. Nevertheless. When Kyuzo slices the prideful guy? When Katsushiro hides behind the door with a stick to weed out scrubs? When Kikuchiyo shames them all for hating on the peasants? Perfect. </p>

<h2> A Room With A View (1985) </h2>
<h3> James Ivory </h3>
<h4> see also: Barry Lyndon, The Wicker Man </h4>
<p> Baby Helena Bonham Carter walks a knife-edge between virgin and chad. (She's been raised with the passive obedience of a virgin, yet plays Beethoven like a total chad). On a trip to Florence with terrible cousin Charlotte, the two of them see some naked statues and fall into the company of chads. Foremost of the chads is George, who is instantly obsessed with BHBC. George positively exudes trickster-bro energy; his main move is unsubtly showing BHBC giant question marks, but when that doesn't work he switches to grabbing and forcibly kissing her. She doesn't know quite what to make of this. Neither does Charlotte, who appears torn between thinking this is super hot and that it is horrifying. Back at home, BHBC agrees to marry Pointy Daniel Day-Lewis, an utter virgin. PDDL's asinine machinations fatefully bring George to the neighborhood, who immediately spoils the deal. George persuades BHBC to escape the life of a virgin with terrible PDDL and terrible Charlotte and her terrible mother. After breaking off their engagement BHBC makes some noises about not needing another man to leave PDDL for. But per title card this is a "lie"; BHBC does <i>not</i> reach escape velocity, settling for option B and running off to Italy again with George.</p>

<h2> Days of Heaven (1978) </h2>
<h3> Terrence Malick </h3>
<p> Villain: locusts, capital. Hero: animals other than locusts, wheat, narrator girl, the low angle of the sun. Beautiful. </p>

<h2> Barton Fink (1991) </h2>
<h3> Joel & Ethan Coen </h3>
<p> One of those movies about Hollywood eating someone alive. Barton is an insufferable New York playwright how goes to LA to make some cash. He finds it vapid, disturbing and scary, but mostly just deeply uninteresting. He's supposed to write a "wrestling picture", but doesn't know what that is and doesn't care to find out. His own art is explicitly about dignifying the common man, but he doesn't know what the common man is like and doesn't care to find out. As flamin' John Goodman puts it, he doesn't listen. But he does get what he deserves. </p>

<h2> The Most Unknown (2018) </h2>
<h3> Ian Cheney </h3>
<h4> see also: Into The Inferno, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Encounters at the End of the World </h4>
<p> Herzog-like (he is credited as an advisor) documentary, though more conventional. Specifically, this is a movie about <i>scientist energy</i>. Nine scientists visit each other's workplaces in a ring-topological arrangement, and mainly we get to watch them just be huge nerds of every type. Hilarious. </p>

<h2> Eyes Wide Shut (1999) </h2>
<h3> Stanley Kubrick </h3>
<p> Tom Cruise slowly repeating the last thing said to him, confused. The reversed chanting and the censer. </p>

<h2> Mapplethorpe (2018) & Variety (1983) </h2>
<h3> Ondi Timoner & Bette Gordon, respectively. </h3>
<p> Commonality: horny 70s-80s NYC. Mapplethorpe is a biopic about the photographer: a narcissist, sometimes cruel to those around him yet also a tireless champion for the beauty and dignity of his subjects. </p>
<p> Variety is about Christine, the ticket-taker at a porno theater box office. She takes the job reluctantly, but goes on to observe the experience with a calm journalistic fascination. Most of the movie revolves around her relationship with Louis Tancredi, a man who hits on her repeatedly at work and whose invitation to a Yankees game she spontaneously accepts. When he leaves suddenly during the game, their relationship as stalker and object of fascination inverts just as abruptly and inexplicably. Christine follows Louis through the night watching him meet people and make mysterious deals at a bus station, a fish market, a motel. Her  observation of Louis blurs together vaguely with her boyfriend (?) Mark's investigative journalism into mafia infiltration of labor unions. Mark however is  put off when Christine begins to recite erotic poetry to him during their distinctly unerotic meetings. She begins reading porno magazines and dressing in lingerie, privately. In the end Christine consummates her fascination with Louis, spooking him over the phone with a recitation of his movements. She sets up a meeting at a street corner, leaving her intentions to the imagination. </p>

<h2> Cameraperson (2016) </h2>
<h3> Kirsten Johnson </h3>
<p> A docu-memoir assembled from footage shot during Johnson's career as a documentary cinematographer plus some home movies. Punctuated by a few intensely striking scenes: the furious boxer, the regretful soldier, the tired midwife. </p>

<h2> Into the Inferno (2016) </h2>
<h3> Werner Herzog </h3>
<p> Good Werner, a straight (?) documentary about scientists, myth, ways of being. Volcanos, plus tangents. The Vanuatans. The vulcanologist and paleoanthropologist. The DPRK. </p>

<h2> Leviathan (2012) </h2>
<h3> Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Verena Paravel </h3>
<p> Darkly psychedelic document of commercial fishing. Hacking the wings from rays. Nauseating. Metal. </p>

<h2> Yojimbo (1961) </h2>
<h3> Akira Kurosawa </h3>
<p> Like Rashomon and Seven Samurai, asks the question: are men of violence incredibly honorable badasses, or weird little babies? Also, it's a Western. I want to know whether this is a remotely realistic depiction of feudal Japan or a surreal double projection via spaghetti of the American west. Like the sherriff ringing the hour with woodblocks... ? </p>

<h2> Dersu Uzala (1975) </h2>
<h3> Akira Kurosawa </h3>
<p> Dersu is a hunter who lives alone in the woods. He talks to fire. He doesn't miss a shot. He fears and respects the tiger. He knows how to not die when some doofus Russian gets him stranded on a frozen lake. Shot in color, very beautiful and melancholy.</p>

<h2> Uncut Gems (2019) </h2>
<h3> Benny & Josh Safdie </h3>
<p> Adam Sandler as Howie, the most annoying person on Earth. Kevin Garnett as himself but obsessed with Howie's giant opal, sourced directly from an Ethiopian mine. Howie and mistress/soulmate Julia are addicted to risk. Tension mounts as Howie wheedles and lies and schemes and pawns, the pounding synth score building until completely unbearable. Then, blammo. </p>

<h2> Stalker (1979) </h2>
<h3> Andrei Tarkovksy </h3>
<p> Mysterious and meditative and gorgeous in that Tarkovsky way. Those vibrating spring sounds as they enter the Zone. Upsetting that probably everyone involved was poisoned by industrial waste while shooting the first version. (Which was <i>lost</i> to bad processing! fuck!)</p>

<h2> The Wicker Man (1973) </h2>
<h3> Robin Hardy </h3>
<h4> see also: Midsommar, A Room With A View </h4>
<p> A lil slice of the British psyche? </p>

<h2> A Clockwork Orange (1971) </h2>
<h3> Stanley Kubrick </h3>
<p> Droogs, Ludwig Van, milk bar, etc</p>

<h2> Mandy (2018) </h2>
<h3> Panos Cosmatos, Casper Kelly </h3>
<p> "The psychotic drowns where the mystic swims" </p>

<h2> Casino (1995) </h2>
<h3> Martin Scorcese </h3>
<p> De Niro's outfits. Joe Pesci's extreme cretinousness. </p>

<h2> Andrei Rublev (1966) </h2>
<h3> Andrei Tarkovksy </h3>
<p> Andrei and the pagans; casting the bell. </p>

<h2> Barry Lyndon (1975) </h2>
<h3> Stanley Kubrick </h3>
<p> Every frame an exquisite painting painted for an 18th century rich guy. </p>

<h2> Midsommar (2019) </h2>
<h3> Ari Aster </h3>
<h4> see also: The Wicker Man </h4>
<p> Enthralling, viscerally upsetting. Harrowing. Starting point is <i>The Wicker Man</i>: hapless interloper(s) beguiled and destroyed by a strange cult. In <i>The Wicker Man</i> we have Sgt Howie, who we jeer at for being such a prude, but whose terror and isloation we also empathize with. In <i>Midsommar</i> these roles are pulled apart into two halves of an awful relationship: the unbearable Christian and the thoroughly traumatized Dani, respectively.</p>
<p>Christian is the center of a horror movie about being a terrible dude. He's the wost possible white American millenial male archetype cranked all the way up. His gaslight burns brighter than the sun. His bullshit is a bottomless midden. To watch him is to see him in yourself or people in your life and cringe *hard* because he's hideous. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Dani is the center of a horror movie about being alone and nigh to the precipice of despair. The movie opens on the murder/suicide of her close family and then relentlessly bombards her with Christian's shittiness as it shuts her every route back to safety and normalcy. Her misery is raw and palpable. To watch her is to feel like you've been crying and may start crying again. </p>
<p> We also have Josh and Mark for traveling companions. Josh is mainly a foil to Christian, a serious anthropology student who shines a light on Christian's extreme unseriousness. But in the end his academic ambition beats out his acedemic ethics and he gets what's coming to him. I'm not super sure what Mark is for, other than comic relief and to fill in a few shades of shittiness that Christian doesn't quite cover. He vapes, he pisses on the sacred tree, he has it coming from the beginning.</p>
<p>So Christian and Dani each provide enough psychological horror for one movie. But there's also <i>the scary cult</i>. Wow, Hårga is a beautiful commune. Such a simple and authentic way of life. Woah, that was freaky with the hammers but we gotta respect their traditions. Lifecycle like the seasons of the year. Hmm I'm rembering that book on Nazi runes Josh had in the car. Oh fuck are those lungs outside his body...did I drink the mushroom tea in real life?</p>
<p>Then the throne of flowers. The bear skin. There is no going back now. <p/>

<h2> Us (2019) </h2>
<h3> Jordan Peele </h3>
<p> Dude can really work an allegory. Great score. </p>
